# Rossmann-Store-Sales-Analysis
The Rossmann Sales Prediction projects are machine learning implementations designed to forecast daily sales for Rossmann drug stores across Europe, using historical data and advanced regression models.
“This project focuses on understanding historical sales behavior and business drivers through exploratory analysis. The outcomes are insight-based and support operational and strategic retail decisions, without relying on predictive modeling.”
